    <h2>High speed internet</h2>
    <p>
        Thats right. The aim of starlink is to have a global coverage of the 
        planet and provide everyone with internet. Or almost everywhere. This 
        might be the best options for people who live in remote places where 
        they havent build poles or underground wires. The satellites will be 
        so low as to provide the fastest possible connection. So low in fact 
        that you could see them in the night sky floating, or falling, across 
        the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you might be thinking that this is a good thing, or thinking that
         about potential problems. And there are both good and bad things about this.
          The good has already been covered. But what are the bad things?
    </p>
    <p>
        Have you ever heard of space debris ,space junk, space waste or space trash
         ? These are objects in orbit. And most of them serve no function. They are 
         in the way of new launches into space. heres a picture
    </p>

    <p>
        Now there are plans on how to deal with this problem. Starlink will have
        their satellites push themselves with thrust out of orbit and await from
        earth. But if it fails the satellite will fall to earth and burn up in 
        the atmosphere. A satellite has a lifespan of roughly 4 years. Then they 
        will become space junk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starlink aims to have a 12,000-satellite megaconstellation in orbit. 
        And there is romers that they are aiming for more. All of these 
        satellites are going to leav marks on the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
        This was just as the satellites were being deployed on was pushed further 
        out into orbit. But with 12.000 satellites there are concerns that they 
        wil one day block the observation of something important or critical
    </p>
    <h2>The satellites</h2>
    <p>
        They will weigh roughly 260 kg per unit. And their design is 
        made so that they can be launched in tight clusters to 
        minimize the amount of launchs needed. Four powerful antennas
        will be mounted on the satellites and will be one of the 
        reasons why can boast about the speed of the internet they
        can provide. They will all be mounted with a single solar panel. 
        These are stadard for allmost all satellites. They are simple to 
        instal and improves the overall life and efficiency of the 
        satellite
    </p>
    <p>
        For propulsion the satellites will use an ion thruster powered by 
        krypton. No, not the home planet of Superman. Its a noble gas. Ion
        thrusters are made to function in near vacuum conditions and thats 
        why satellites in the Starlink project will use them. Each satellite 
        will be equipped with a star tracker. This will make sure that they 
        stay in orbit and in the correct hight and position to provide the high
        speed connection
    </p>
    <h2>A solution or a problem</h2>
    <p>
        The satellites will be equipped with autonomous collision avoidance 
        systems. The will have a link directly to and working with the 
        Department of Defense's debris tracking system. They will use this 
        system and the ion proupolsers to avoid other satellites and space 
        junk. So with less collisions there will be less space junk. And 
        as you have already read the satellites from starlink will, at 
        the end of the life cycle, thrust themselves out of orbit or fall 
        and burn in the atmosphere. But what if something goes wrong ?
    </p>
    <p>
        We have already talked about space junk. and Starlink aims to make 
        sure that their satellites does not become part of the problem. But 
        there is a chance that a handful of the 12.000 satellites fail or 
        collide with something and then does not leav the orbit or burn in 
        the atmosphere. Some satellites will take many years, many hundreds
        of them, to leave orbit or fall and burn. So if one percent of the
        Starlink satellites fail and stays in orbit for a hundred years,
        thats 120 new space junks added to the night sky that one day 
        might block a signal or observation.
