        The internett is an amazing tool
    </h2>
    <p>
        This is how it started. in the 1960s as a way for 
        government researchers to share information the internett 
        started. Back in the day computers where lager and to share 
        information was diffecult. Another catalyst in the formation 
        of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet 
        Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. 
        Defense Department to consider ways information could still be 
        disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led 
        to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects 
        Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what 
        we now know as the Internet. ARPANET was a great success but 
        membership was limited to certain academic and research 
        organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department. 
        In response to this, other networks were created to provide 
        information sharing.

    <h2>
        But not everyone has access to it
    </h2>
    <p>
        in mid 2019 the world had 7.7 billion people. 
        Thats a lot of people. But how many do you think 
        has access to the internett?
    </p>
    <p>
        4.4 billion is the right answer. thats just about half.
        We use the internet everyday. And most of us 
        don't think of it. its just a way of life now. 
        We see something we like, snap a photo of it, 
        and share it on social media. We need directions 
        or are lost and simply open our smart phone and 
        google maps wil help you. If your haveing a 
        heated debate and want to fact check you can 
        google it from enywhere. Have you 
        even heard of a encyclopedia ? have you ever seen one?

        But there is a plan !
    </h2>
    <p>
        Have you heard of starlink? No ? It is an 
        ambitious project to bring the internet to 
        people who doesn't have it. There are many 
        reasons to why they dont have. it might be 
        too hard to build in the region they live
         inn. so this is a great way to give people
          who live without it a chance to experiance
           it

        But thats not all satelites are used for. what els is there you ask ?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Let's start with the biggest satellite Earth has,
        the Moon. Surprised? The definition of satellite
        is ,in the context of spaceflight, a satellite 
        is an object that has been intentionally placed
        into orbit. These objects are called artificial
        satellites to distinguish them from natural 
        satellites such as Earth's Moon. Now that you 
        know what a satellite is let's move on
    </p>
    <p>
        Common types include Earth observation satellites.
        such as environmental monitoring, meteorology,
         map making. So they are used in, trying. to 
         predict the weather and follow natural disasters
          such as hurricanes and storms.
    </p>
    <p>
        GPS. Maybe you knew this one but it is an important function. 
        And they do so much more. like map the stars. But there are problems
        as well. They do provide communication but they also block 
        some types. Like radio, and images from observatories
